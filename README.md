# Hello World

> Template repository for getting started with and deploying a MkDocs
project

## About

This repository demonstrates how to create a static site using Sphinx.
This repository does not demonstrate how to convert API docstrings into
API documentation.

In addition to writing static site content, this repository contains
pre-commit hooks, config files, a simple "Hello World" website, Makefile
directives to build the site into HTML files, and a GitHub Action
workflow to deploy the site onto GitHub pages. All dependencies are
listed in the pyproject.toml file in the root of the directory.

## How To Develop

Assuming that you have cloned the repository:

``make create-dev``

This will create a Python virtual environment, install Poetry into it,
and download dependencies managed by Poetry.

### Config Files

The following config files can be found in the root of the directory:

-  ``pyproject.toml``: Poetry project config file
-  ``docs/conf.py``: Sphinx config file
-  ``.markdownlint.json``: Markdown Lint config file
-  ``.mdformat.toml``: MD Format config file
-  ``.pre-commit-config.json``: pre-commit config file config file

## How To Build

-  ``make build-html`` to build the HTML version of the site, or

### HTML

The HTML content of the site is stored in the root level `html`
directory.

## How To Deploy

``make deploy-gh`` will commit the current project root-level ``html``
directory to the root of a ``gh-pages`` branch.

Once executed, in your GitHub project, confgure GitHub Pages to read
from the root of the gh-pages branch.
