## About

This is a template repository that is intended to be inherited by other template
repositories *to ensure consistent common tool deployment Sphinx projects*.

Additionally, while projects can leverage this template or its content,
extending this template is encouraged.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

This template is dependent upon Python 3.13 and `uv`.

It is recommended to install `pre-commit` as well for per-commit formatting and
linting checks.

### Creating The Dev Environment

`make create-dev`

### Building The Sphinx Site

`make build_project`

### Serving The Sphinx Site

`make serve`

## Hosting On GitHub Pages

Any time that a commit is pushed to GitHub from the `main` branch, the
[`build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml) workflow is executed which builds the
project and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

You will need to modify the ReStructured Text directory in the
[`build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml) from `template_sphinx` to the name of
your project's directory. You can find the line to modify by searching for
`# TODO` in the [`build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml) file. An example of
what to look for is this code block:

```yaml
- name: Build the site
  run: |
    ./.venv/bin/sphinx-build --write-all template_sphinx build
    # TODO: Change `template_sphinx` to the source directory
```

You can also deploy the project from the `main` branch at any time (so long as
the `workflow_dispatch` event is included in the
[`build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml) file) from the GitHub Actions page
